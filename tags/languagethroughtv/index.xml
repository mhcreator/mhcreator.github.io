&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to start this blog post! But in this blog post, I want to share about the scholarships that I am applying for to achieve my Dream of Studying in Japan for my higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-story-with-japanese-scholarships&#34;&gt;My Story with Japanese Scholarships!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started applying last year to any opportunity I could find&amp;hellip; and I have started with the most popular MEXT scholarship journey began with embassy track! I passed the exam section, and the interview section, but then not accepted with the nomination section of MEXT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not feel tearful when it happened because it&amp;rsquo;s scholarships and the count of people who were is many. And there was the university track! Yet, I remember telling myself, that I must have said something in the interview or maybe because my Japanese Language was beginner since I could not attend the exam accurately. Or it could be that they do not accept my field of study&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not make any difference at the end of the day I had to just take it easy and do what I had to do. I&amp;rsquo;ll apply for this year also when it opens..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University track&lt;/strong&gt; was no good also!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the field they were offering the scholarship was not my study field. I did my search and looked for universities that can offer the field and the scholarship and I did the second part of e-mailing the professor&amp;hellip; got one response who told me he is retiring and can&amp;rsquo;t have me; the other no reply till now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am not complaining I am stating the facts only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;
Yesterday that date 5/2/2025 morning I had another inconsolable news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After, my ADB-JSP scholarship experience started! This scholarship had a condition that I was aware of but I did not remember &amp;lsquo;my bad&amp;rsquo;, which was to have 2 years at least after graduation, they don&amp;rsquo;t count life time work experience&amp;hellip; which is very depressing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the terms and conditions but, I wonder what kind of term is this?? Why what different it is going to make having prior or post experience? I want to know if there is a reason behind this since most of the study abroad scholarship have it. I was deman ready and felt that this time I&amp;rsquo;d have it. Literally, everything was going smoothly and all documents were up and ready, guess it was not the right time for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclution&#34;&gt;Conclution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just needed to share this here Hopefully someday I&amp;rsquo;ll have the answer! Maybe when the moment comes for me; this will be proof for me that everyone will get through. Also, I hope this helps somebody if face my situation. What makes me go through it.. is having a family, not any family a family that makes whatever in mind smaller and you can do it to a 3000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as it is still new to overcoming this scholarship rejections I am taking it easy and I&amp;rsquo;ll take my time to apply for other scholarships. Since my goal is to complete my studies abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For next week&amp;rsquo;s blog.. I change the topic to a career perspective. Cause if I let this go on it will end it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language | Part 2</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/my-fifth-post/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0005.png" alt="Featured image of post How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language | Part 2" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the background of How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share the resources that helped me learn the Japanese language for the self-study method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my N5 test result&amp;hellip; I got the result today morning 31 Jan 2025. And why I am doing the JLPT exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;resourses-to-help-study-japanese&#34;&gt;Resourses to help study Japanese:
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, as I begin to check what are the best resources for self-study or is good to just find a course online or attend a language course at a campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the latter since the first takes a lot to explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For face-to-face campus:&lt;/strong&gt;
There is an amazing university called &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.numl.edu.pk/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NUML University&lt;/a&gt;, this uni specializes in Languages there are almost all languages that a person interested in can learn, and they provide various levels starting with certificates to diplomas also, some have Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees and few have Master Degree. But first, check their website to know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it came to me, their times were not suitable for me because I was working. So, I said let me try self-study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self Study:&lt;/strong&gt;
I did my first online course for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://minato-jf.jp/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Japanese Language&lt;/a&gt; I did Marugoto for a while. Eventually, I decided last year in July that I would do the JLPT Exam, yet I was confused between N5 and N4 since N3 I felt there was a lot on me. In the end, my decision was N5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have missed the date for July 2024. I had to wait and apply for the Des 2024 Test. This gives me like 6 months to really prepare for the first time. I planned to check some videos on Youtube by people who have taken the exam, to create my plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a Study Book, I have picked from the two famous books Ginki and &lt;strong&gt;Mina no Nihon Go&lt;/strong&gt; the latter. The Study book had everything but, I have put all the required Kanji for N5 in a section in my copy so I can memorize them in my free time, a section for every lesson grammar, and a section for vocabulary with answering book questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to study for 4 hours but to behonest life won&amp;rsquo;t relieve you for it grap so when I could not I had to make up time to waste hours. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the whole book before the exam, I have just finished 5 first lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not focus on writing much and speaking since these skills are not tested in the exam, it&amp;rsquo;s a Muiltbull choice question, for Reading, Grammar, vocabulary, and lastly Listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; You can enhance your skills of speaking and writing if you wish when preparing for the exam but you need to put extra time and effort. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t because my life experience is different from you all, and I respect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please find the Links to resources in the &lt;strong&gt;Links Section&lt;/strong&gt; I used to help me study the language on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after I have given you some brief about my studying plan I still choose learning by myself for my N3 JLPT. My reason for studying Japanese it may sound silly but I want to watch anime without subtitles and as I am trying to find an opportunity to complete my higher studies in Japan, I want to be comfortable with the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My result of the 1st Des 2024 Exam as shown, it shows that I did not pass! But considering everything I have mentioned above, I see an achievement and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bring the maximum score I want the passing which is 80. Yet, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have them this time.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, My plan now is to prepare for N3 as I have a whole year to prepare for the exam. And if I did not pass that one I&amp;rsquo;ll repeat it till I get the passing score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/my-forth-post/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 16:52:13 +0500</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/my-forth-post/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0004.png" alt="Featured image of post How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the topic, today&amp;rsquo;s blog is about Using entertainment for language skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I remember!üòá After high school I was easily taking my life, cause all I knew back then was that my life hit a dead wall for some reason I will keep off this time, to focus on today&amp;rsquo;s topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around 2011 and 2012 or maybe 2013, when I had one main idea in my mind which was how I can develop my language skills. My main focus was the English Language because my mother tongue wasn&amp;rsquo;t English.üòè&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the resources to help myself find new vocals; there were English songs and TV series! But what was on TV I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it!ü•∏ Because the Internet had amazing options like a series called Supernatural, Sam was my favorite! I saw the first of two seasons on TV and when I checked the Internet they were during the 3rd or 4th season, I needed to catch on&amp;hellip;üòé&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, back then I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about torrents!üòÅ The websites I had were paid to watch not free &amp;ldquo;I know nothing is supposed to be free for copywrites&amp;rdquo;. But It&amp;rsquo;s not me it was away at that time and it was normal at the time. Also, there were some illegal websites for a person like me who could not pay to watch for free&amp;hellip;.!üòÆ‚Äçüí®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bummer was they did not have American series they had &lt;strong&gt;Korean drama, Japanese drama, and Anime!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-is-how-everything-started&#34;&gt;Here Is How Everything Started!üò≥
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began watching first with Korean Drama; Coffee Prince my all-time favorite. Then Boys Before Flowers&amp;hellip; and some that I don&amp;rsquo;t remember now. It helped me gain new words every day cause Korean I wasn&amp;rsquo;t understand so, I checked the subtitles to know what happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really helped me be good at Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading: I had to read the subtitles to understand what was happening. Any word I did not know I used to ask my cousin and the early Google translator which use to suck. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember using a dictionary&amp;hellip; hmmm I don&amp;rsquo;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing: taking up words and writing them on my notes was that was all. And I used to use them in writing on my FB Page, massaging my friends &amp;hellip; that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking: I begin using them with my own language! This helped me know how to pronounce it correctly. It got me some laughs on but no worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening: this was tricky since by listening to Korean a lot I really became familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brilliant Idea Come-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t I start also learning Korean! I&amp;rsquo;ll hit two birds with one stone since learning languages has become my goal. And I did it and started learning the alphabet and watching. I kept doing this for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my friend N &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;her name starts with N&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, to avoid any confusion. She told me to watch an anime with her and I did not resist yet, I welcomed the idea. Gosick was the one I began with my friend watching the anime. After that, I am still watching anime. I started loving Japan, Japanese culture, and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-think-ending-this-blog-here-is-a-good-idea&#34;&gt;I Think Ending This Blog Here, Is A Good Idea!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fancy kind of story is here.ü§≠ I can proudly say that I have passed my IELTS exam with a very pleasant mark and I did my N5 first JLPT exam on Dec 2024; still waiting for the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can have another special blog on My favorite anime, How I prepare for the N5 JLPT exam, and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll share my IELTS success story! I may share my own tips for learning languages as self-study.And the best resources that I used from ppl I saw as experts in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, till next Friday, take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
