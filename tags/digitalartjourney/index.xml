        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0007.png" alt="Featured image of post My Artistic Path! Blender, Social Media, and Self-Doubt" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;People pleasing planet got a million people saying how to plan it&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Imagine Dragons&amp;rdquo;. I am vibing with their song today. 🎧♫♪♫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, today&amp;rsquo;s weather was nice; windy + the sun shone brightly with a pinch of clouds and flowers starting to bloom again. &amp;ldquo;Grateful Face&amp;rdquo;☀️🌾🤗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actully, I am struggling with what to write for this blog! I was thinking of writing about my favorite anime! But no it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a lot and I feel tired now, maybe because of I just had my dinner.🥱😴&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this blog post will be about pursuing my creative passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-did-grow-on-me&#34;&gt;How It did Grow on me!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning 3D art with Blender beginning was the Donut tutorial from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Blender Guru&lt;/a&gt;. I remember working on it for the first time and was around 2020 since I was unemployed hehe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honestly, I wanted this time to last forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you know we humans are a very difficult species! Or maybe it is just me.
I felt unhonest. Like it is a lie I&amp;rsquo;m telling to myself, that being an digital artist is not my interest. Literally, this is what I told myself that I was just going to use my free time in this, and I&amp;rsquo;ll apply for real jobs like the one that was in my mind Content Writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;guess-what-&#34;&gt;Guess What! 😔
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I believe 6 months of creating 3D models with Blender, I have stopped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing about this now makes me realize the heartache. Because.. yeah when I started the job I was into it, to know all the ins and outs then shifted to another position as a Social Media Executive. This position too got me excited to work with dynamic creative writing with social media, I was fascinatie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, doing all by being busy with work and my studies, I still felt the urge that I was doing something wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s not what I wanted to do. And from all the things I was interested in, my interest in 3D did not die. I was following the Blender Guru newsletter and following **&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.blender.org/features/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt;**news always checking out their yearly event for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up this Blog, I am going to say two things to overcoming self-doubt in creativity. 😎👌🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, don&amp;rsquo;t you ever leave yourself without an interest, and if you find it &lt;strong&gt;Do Not&lt;/strong&gt; let yourself foul you. That it&amp;rsquo;s not what you are supposed to do, I am still trying to stop myself! Even after I made up my mind that this is what I want to be doing till I leave this earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dont miss this sign; if you are feeling happy while doing it.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep doing it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I have an account on Instagram, which I intend to share my beginner&amp;rsquo;s journey in digital art in 2D and intermediate in 3D. As I left my last job position as assistant manager in the Social Media Team, I thought doing social media for yourself was really easy. No, it&amp;rsquo;s not, even with experience in social media, becasue I can be lazy. &amp;ldquo;I try my best&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this time I leave you with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ If you hear a voice within you say you cannot paint, then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced.” ― Van Gogh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
