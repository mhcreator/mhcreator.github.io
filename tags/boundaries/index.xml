&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; I think when I started blogging, Iâ€™ve started noticing the things I go through each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because before blogging, no matter what I had gone through â€” I really could not recall it. 0_0 hehehe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it is one of the advantages of blogging, I guess.
(Cause no matter whoever said it â€” I wouldnâ€™t believe it. But when doing it â€” it makes sense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me dive in â€” into this blog postâ€™s topic!
Which is something that happened in my life in the last two weeks.
Thatâ€™s why I mentioned blogging helps me remember when things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the topic is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not interfere or take sides when two individuals you love have a fight or misunderstanding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonâ€™t spill all the details, since itâ€™s not my matter â€” and I didnâ€™t ask their permission to talk about it.
But it was something between a loving father and a loving daughter. Both of them are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of them wanted a certain life decision, and the other couldnâ€™t bear it â€”
since it wasnâ€™t something they were satisfied with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I took the side of one of them â€” maybe because I wanted to fix something that happened in the past. Yetâ€¦ it was the present moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I took the side immediately, without really listening to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus â€” things really escalated, my fears and anger got me blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stopped sleeping, eating well, and thinking while sleeping! I say this because I remember sleeping on the same thought and waking up on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even worse â€” I couldnâ€™t do my daily tasks or at least live the way I want to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve learned a lot from this life lesson. Not because I was a brilliant, wise thinker. No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I felt that something wasnâ€™t working â€” and I had a person who really was there and gave me the real talk that even shut me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having a person in your life â€” family member or friend â€” who can bring you back to your senses and logical mind? Itâ€™s a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end this blog here, Iâ€™ll just say:
Iâ€™ve learned the lesson and dis-attached myself from other peopleâ€™s life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
