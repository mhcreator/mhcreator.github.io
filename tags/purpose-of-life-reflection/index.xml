&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t write a blog last week because I was under the weather, struggling with seasonal flu. It wasn’t pleasant at all. I keep wondering—why does this happen? When I was younger and living in a different geographic location, I never experienced this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after moving to a new place, it started happening, and each time, it hit me hard. For years, I made sure to get a flu shot annually. However, last year, I thought, let me skip it and see what happens. Well, turns out, I couldn’t handle it. So, on Tuesday, I finally got the flu shot, and I’ve been feeling much better in the past couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my little update, but now, let’s get into the real topic of this blog—something that’s been on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-point-of-living-or-having-a-life&#34;&gt;What Is the Point Of Living? or Having a Life?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why, but this question keeps looping in my mind, especially when I’m sick. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time it struck me—it was in my last year of high school. I kept thinking, No matter how long you live or how much you try to achieve, eventually, you’ll end up in the grave. So what’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I was feeling down at the time because my educational path wasn’t clear. But even now, after finishing university, I still ask myself the same question. Sure, completing my degree made me happy, but did it dramatically change my life? Not really. It gave me some direction, like my goal to study abroad, but even if that doesn’t happen, life will just keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at it from another angle—marriage or work. We chase after them, but once we have them, they come with their own struggles. Being single or a freelancer isn’t necessarily easier; you become your own judge and prisoner to your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even having dreams and goals can feel heavy. When they don’t work out, you feel crushed. And when they do, sometimes they don’t bring the satisfaction you expected. So, what’s the point? Life will go on, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So!!! What is what matters for reall?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly? I don’t know. Some say it’s about the emotions you experience—they change you. But even if you change, life itself doesn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before anyone worries—no, I don’t have any intentions of ending my life, nor do I have any known mental health issues. I’m just asking a question that I think many people ask themselves at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not looking for an answer, because honestly, anyone who claims to have one is probably lying. Instead, I think the real challenge is finding a way to keep moving forward while still trying to make sense of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s just take it easy—until next time. ✌️&lt;/p&gt;
