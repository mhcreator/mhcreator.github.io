&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you have appreciated yourself!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the idea Iâ€™ve been thinking about since I woke up today. Before writing the blog post, I had to read these &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thomsinger.medium.com/how-to-appreciate-yourself-88947f58ec3b&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;heart soothing words&lt;/a&gt; by
Thom Singer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the moment you feel unappreciated â€” especially the need from the exterior world â€” itâ€™s a sign that you are not doing it for yourself enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I have been thinking today is that there are a few things â€” when I do them â€” I know and feel that I am not appreciating myself by doing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a close person sees that my time is okay to be wasted. Yet itâ€™s not&amp;hellip; And they know my reaction is always yes. I love helping people, and I can do more even when I am busy or overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this has got to stop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things in my life are on hold! Because I have no time management when it comes to loved ones. I am fully dividing my time for others and taking only a small portion of it for my own tasks â€” and at the end, lots of unfinished tasks build up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also seen that when it&amp;rsquo;s my time to ask something from them, they put me on hold or tell me theyâ€™re not free or will schedule it for another time â€” no matter how small the task is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that I have been in a discovery mode since this year began! I am rethinking many aspects and ideas that I thought were my life rules and principles. But as human nature shows, change is the only factor we rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as Iâ€™ve started to love myself â€” the physical body â€” I need to change my mental behavior toward myself. By really focusing on my needs to learn, and putting time into doing the things I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to act with love toward myself. So, Iâ€™ll just be taking it easy this time.
Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
