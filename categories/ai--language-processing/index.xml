&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I start thinking about what to write for this week&amp;rsquo;s blog post, all ideas seem to run away, leaving me with an empty head and struggling to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just talk about what I found fascinating this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) Marketing as a field of study. 🤩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know that feeling when you&amp;rsquo;re searching for something you genuinely enjoy? Well, I finally found it! I’ve been on a mission to discover a field that combines AI and Marketing, specifically Digital Marketing, and I came across it at Busan University of Foreign Studies – Artificial Intelligence Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this gem while browsing the university’s overview PDF, and let me tell you—I was beyond excited! 😳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field brings together everything I enjoy: AI, Languages, and Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working in social media marketing, I often used AI for content creation, and honestly, it was a game-changer! Crafting the right prompts, experimenting with AI-generated content, and refining strategies with my team was such an engaging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would share prompts, analyze AI-generated responses, and study different resources to improve our results. The collaboration was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But There Was a Downside&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI sometimes started acting different. 😅 Maybe it was because I wasn’t using the paid version, or perhaps my prompts weren’t structured well! IDK for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, the AI-generated content felt repetitive, overly philosophical, or too academic—which isn’t ideal for social media marketing. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms cater to everyone—from highly educated professionals to casual users. Our job as marketers is to deliver clear, engaging, and easy-to-understand content that drives action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our writing is too complex, or if our graphics/videos are overloaded with information, they won’t work—except maybe for Japanese audiences (check the link to know why 🧐). And I want to really use their way of desgining, I&amp;rsquo;ll share when I&amp;rsquo;ll use it and how sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is: Keep it simple, clear, and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-like-it&#34;&gt;Why I Like It?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why do I find this field so exciting? Here are my reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ It feels like I’m training something &amp;lt; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can call it device the AI&amp;gt; the language of how to understand &amp;amp; communicate better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ Languages fascinate me! I recently heard someone point out something interesting which I know but was not present in my mind: English assigns (She/He when talking about Woman/Man), just like Japanese and Arabic, but Urdu doesn’t &amp;ldquo;آپ (Ap)&amp;rdquo; is used for both genders! 🤯
I beleive there are other languages, I&amp;rsquo;ll check it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ I already have experience in digital marketing, so I know this field would be amazing to study!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also checked out the course curriculum, and it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for! There’s &amp;ldquo;Introduction to AI Marketing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Digital Platform Marketing.&amp;rdquo; The first one, in particular, has me hooked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, training AI to understand different languages and cultural nuances sounds like an incredible challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, I’m applying to Busan University of Foreign Studies – Artificial Intelligence Marketing, and I’ll be looking for similar programs in other universities as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And until I get accepted into one, I plan to experiment with AI to train it in the Urdu language and of course, I’ll share everything here.!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till then, take it easy! ✌️&lt;/p&gt;
