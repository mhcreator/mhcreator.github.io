&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I want to argue a point of view that I have been hearing a lot for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which is:&lt;/strong&gt; Women need to lower their standards, especially when it comes to relationships!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to suggest something to all the guys who say this and relationship coaches ‚Äî especially: why don‚Äôt you say this instead? &amp;ldquo;Read Below.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you say to the guys who cannot find an understandable woman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be polite. No need for money or status ‚Äî representing yourself with politeness is one way to get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humor is an amazing personality trait to have! But know how to use it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education degree is good, but if you have good understanding of your surroundings and how to utilize problem solving with critical thinking in a calm way, then I am sorry not sorry ‚Äî put your degree in a cup of water and drink it. Maybe it will be useful. Hypothetically, a way to at least drink the knowledge since your brilliant mind could not have the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do work on upgrading your knowledge, and these days you have plenty of ways to do it. Read a book, watch documentaries, involve yourself in workshops, or learn a craft. Make yourself useful to her. I know people who have nothing to brag about except their good behavior and usefulness, and women agree on what they have. And I can see that she is way smarter than him, and I believe he knows it ‚Äî yet he is not downsizing her. Instead, he is also using her knowledge for his life tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, guys, as you are asking for things, make sure you meet what she asks for! Because this is what made the standard higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girls, have your standard met. If he agrees and asks for time to meet your standard, understand him ‚Äî give him time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean here by standards is not money, status, or fame. No, I mean behavior-wise, maturity, emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1- Tip: Ask her, who is your favorite actor? If she says anything about the character he played, listen to her ‚Äî she is telling you about the way of treating her, okay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she said otherwise, then it is up to you if you want to stay or leave. She is materialistic if you are thinking to have an understanding one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- Tip: Watch this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406046/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13911628/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;series&lt;/a&gt;. Look please at what the male character did to show his usefulness and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Is the Point of Living? A Thoughtful Reflection</title>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn‚Äôt write a blog last week because I was under the weather, struggling with seasonal flu. It wasn‚Äôt pleasant at all. I keep wondering‚Äîwhy does this happen? When I was younger and living in a different geographic location, I never experienced this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after moving to a new place, it started happening, and each time, it hit me hard. For years, I made sure to get a flu shot annually. However, last year, I thought, let me skip it and see what happens. Well, turns out, I couldn‚Äôt handle it. So, on Tuesday, I finally got the flu shot, and I‚Äôve been feeling much better in the past couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my little update, but now, let‚Äôs get into the real topic of this blog‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs been on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-point-of-living-or-having-a-life&#34;&gt;What Is the Point Of Living? or Having a Life?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know why, but this question keeps looping in my mind, especially when I‚Äôm sick. üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time it struck me‚Äîit was in my last year of high school. I kept thinking, No matter how long you live or how much you try to achieve, eventually, you‚Äôll end up in the grave. So what‚Äôs the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I was feeling down at the time because my educational path wasn‚Äôt clear. But even now, after finishing university, I still ask myself the same question. Sure, completing my degree made me happy, but did it dramatically change my life? Not really. It gave me some direction, like my goal to study abroad, but even if that doesn‚Äôt happen, life will just keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs look at it from another angle‚Äîmarriage or work. We chase after them, but once we have them, they come with their own struggles. Being single or a freelancer isn‚Äôt necessarily easier; you become your own judge and prisoner to your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even having dreams and goals can feel heavy. When they don‚Äôt work out, you feel crushed. And when they do, sometimes they don‚Äôt bring the satisfaction you expected. So, what‚Äôs the point? Life will go on, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So!!! What is what matters for reall?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly? I don‚Äôt know. Some say it‚Äôs about the emotions you experience‚Äîthey change you. But even if you change, life itself doesn‚Äôt care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before anyone worries‚Äîno, I don‚Äôt have any intentions of ending my life, nor do I have any known mental health issues. I‚Äôm just asking a question that I think many people ask themselves at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not looking for an answer, because honestly, anyone who claims to have one is probably lying. Instead, I think the real challenge is finding a way to keep moving forward while still trying to make sense of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let‚Äôs just take it easy‚Äîuntil next time. ‚úåÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
