&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I donâ€™t know much about motherhood â€” but I do know itâ€™s very hard.
In this blog post, Iâ€™ll try to explain where I stand on the matter, because for a long time, it has been one of my biggest fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I saw the difference between being just a parent-mother and being a real mother. A parent-mother only cares about bringing kids into the world. A mother, on the other hand, takes care of everything â€” from a childâ€™s appearance to their inner emotional and mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After witnessing this contrast, I promised myself that I wouldnâ€™t bring anyone into this world through me. Life continued to show me that parenting is not a game. And I believe these parent-mothers, who only focus on birthing children, often cause long-term harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when their kids grow up and start to wake up to reality, they go through grief â€” some break down, others spend years just trying to figure themselves out, usually without any healthy emotional tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few real-life examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to be okay with yourself: If your subconscious is wired to believe that you are the problem, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to understand and deal with fear: When your body and mind are used to living in constant fear, even peaceful moments feel like a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to trust yourself: This one is the hardest. You think youâ€™ve faced the issue and solved it â€” but then something takes you back to square one, deeper into the original wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a life partner: You may meet the right person â€” but instead of building a calm future together, your unresolved wounds make the relationship full of unnecessary obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me define a few terms, from my point of view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parent-Mother: Someone only concerned with reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother: Someone who knows she can&amp;rsquo;t be everything, but chooses to seek help â€” from the father, grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, and uncles â€” to raise her child in a healthy way. By telling them her way some they can conturbite right. She focuses on understanding rather than always being right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatâ€™s all for today. Just take it easy. ðŸŒ±&lt;/p&gt;
