&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this week‚Äôs blog post, I didn‚Äôt think that much as I always do. Because once I saw the episode of the show, I knew this is what my blog post will be about.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://youtu.be/7Ei_oa-vaJA?si=-5xGTZBiiPfJje6g&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Joe Rogan Experience #2312 - Jeremy Renner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me dive in straight away&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know there could be many people with a life story like this or even more heartache. But for me, this one really touched me. Just as these gentlemen ended their conversation, I say I appreciate both of you for bringing this to me. It resonated deep. Thank you &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was shocking to hear what happened to him. I remember the first thought that came to my mind ‚Äî I felt that he was going to leave us. The other thing was that I didn‚Äôt want to hear anything about it, because it was painful when you‚Äôve gone through the same experience with your own family. That made me very sad for his family ‚Äî they were going to feel his absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after a while, I heard my brother saying that he is recovering. I said to myself‚Ä¶ really? That is good news. I even checked Google for the news, and it was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that ‚Äî maybe last year or the beginning of this year ‚Äî I saw his appearance on&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://youtu.be/JN8E8HT3uiU?si=-C4S9qWgyvcjnelh&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jeremy Renner on How His Near-Death Experience Changed His Outlook on Life (Extended)&lt;/a&gt; I hit &amp;ldquo;watch&amp;rdquo; immediately, and I felt blessed that he is back and alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when I finished the experience with Joe, I just want to say to Jeremy: (Thank you. I was hopeless).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his question: ‚ÄúWhat is the alternative?‚Äù
When Joe asked him how did you heal quickly, how do you keep a positive mindset, how did you get yourself out of the situation?
His answer was: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the alternative?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I will give a moment to take My Next Breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who stumbles here to read my blog post, I have two things and I‚Äôll end this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the question ‚Äî in every aspect of your life that takes you to an uncertain future. This question will bring you back to the moment, since this is the only moment you have. It will also help you find the alternative, or to enjoy what you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the episode to bring yourself some logic and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take it easy, till next week. ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
