&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the topic, today&amp;rsquo;s blog is about Using entertainment for language skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I remember!üòá After high school I was easily taking my life, cause all I knew back then was that my life hit a dead wall for some reason I will keep off this time, to focus on today&amp;rsquo;s topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around 2011 and 2012 or maybe 2013, when I had one main idea in my mind which was how I can develop my language skills. My main focus was the English Language because my mother tongue wasn&amp;rsquo;t English.üòè&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the resources to help myself find new vocals; there were English songs and TV series! But what was on TV I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it!ü•∏ Because the Internet had amazing options like a series called Supernatural, Sam was my favorite! I saw the first of two seasons on TV and when I checked the Internet they were during the 3rd or 4th season, I needed to catch on&amp;hellip;üòé&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, back then I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about torrents!üòÅ The websites I had were paid to watch not free &amp;ldquo;I know nothing is supposed to be free for copywrites&amp;rdquo;. But It&amp;rsquo;s not me it was away at that time and it was normal at the time. Also, there were some illegal websites for a person like me who could not pay to watch for free&amp;hellip;.!üòÆ‚Äçüí®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bummer was they did not have American series they had &lt;strong&gt;Korean drama, Japanese drama, and Anime!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-is-how-everything-started&#34;&gt;Here Is How Everything Started!üò≥
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began watching first with Korean Drama; Coffee Prince my all-time favorite. Then Boys Before Flowers&amp;hellip; and some that I don&amp;rsquo;t remember now. It helped me gain new words every day cause Korean I wasn&amp;rsquo;t understand so, I checked the subtitles to know what happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really helped me be good at Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading: I had to read the subtitles to understand what was happening. Any word I did not know I used to ask my cousin and the early Google translator which use to suck. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember using a dictionary&amp;hellip; hmmm I don&amp;rsquo;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing: taking up words and writing them on my notes was that was all. And I used to use them in writing on my FB Page, massaging my friends &amp;hellip; that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking: I begin using them with my own language! This helped me know how to pronounce it correctly. It got me some laughs on but no worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening: this was tricky since by listening to Korean a lot I really became familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brilliant Idea Come-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t I start also learning Korean! I&amp;rsquo;ll hit two birds with one stone since learning languages has become my goal. And I did it and started learning the alphabet and watching. I kept doing this for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my friend N &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;her name starts with N&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, to avoid any confusion. She told me to watch an anime with her and I did not resist yet, I welcomed the idea. Gosick was the one I began with my friend watching the anime. After that, I am still watching anime. I started loving Japan, Japanese culture, and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-think-ending-this-blog-here-is-a-good-idea&#34;&gt;I Think Ending This Blog Here, Is A Good Idea!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fancy kind of story is here.ü§≠ I can proudly say that I have passed my IELTS exam with a very pleasant mark and I did my N5 first JLPT exam on Dec 2024; still waiting for the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can have another special blog on My favorite anime, How I prepare for the N5 JLPT exam, and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll share my IELTS success story! I may share my own tips for learning languages as self-study.And the best resources that I used from ppl I saw as experts in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, till next Friday, take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
