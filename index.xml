        <title>Appreciation Begins Within: A Self-Reflection</title>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you have appreciated yourself!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the idea I’ve been thinking about since I woke up today. Before writing the blog post, I had to read these &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thomsinger.medium.com/how-to-appreciate-yourself-88947f58ec3b&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;heart soothing words&lt;/a&gt; by
Thom Singer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the moment you feel unappreciated — especially the need from the exterior world — it’s a sign that you are not doing it for yourself enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I have been thinking today is that there are a few things — when I do them — I know and feel that I am not appreciating myself by doing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a close person sees that my time is okay to be wasted. Yet it’s not&amp;hellip; And they know my reaction is always yes. I love helping people, and I can do more even when I am busy or overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this has got to stop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things in my life are on hold! Because I have no time management when it comes to loved ones. I am fully dividing my time for others and taking only a small portion of it for my own tasks — and at the end, lots of unfinished tasks build up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also seen that when it&amp;rsquo;s my time to ask something from them, they put me on hold or tell me they’re not free or will schedule it for another time — no matter how small the task is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that I have been in a discovery mode since this year began! I am rethinking many aspects and ideas that I thought were my life rules and principles. But as human nature shows, change is the only factor we rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I’ve started to love myself — the physical body — I need to change my mental behavior toward myself. By really focusing on my needs to learn, and putting time into doing the things I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to act with love toward myself. So, I’ll just be taking it easy this time.
Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Caught in the Middle: Why I Don’t Interfere in Loved Ones&#39; Disagreements Anymore</title>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; I think when I started blogging, I’ve started noticing the things I go through each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because before blogging, no matter what I had gone through — I really could not recall it. 0_0 hehehe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it is one of the advantages of blogging, I guess.
(Cause no matter whoever said it — I wouldn’t believe it. But when doing it — it makes sense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me dive in — into this blog post’s topic!
Which is something that happened in my life in the last two weeks.
That’s why I mentioned blogging helps me remember when things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the topic is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not interfere or take sides when two individuals you love have a fight or misunderstanding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t spill all the details, since it’s not my matter — and I didn’t ask their permission to talk about it.
But it was something between a loving father and a loving daughter. Both of them are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of them wanted a certain life decision, and the other couldn’t bear it —
since it wasn’t something they were satisfied with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I took the side of one of them — maybe because I wanted to fix something that happened in the past. Yet… it was the present moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I took the side immediately, without really listening to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus — things really escalated, my fears and anger got me blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stopped sleeping, eating well, and thinking while sleeping! I say this because I remember sleeping on the same thought and waking up on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even worse — I couldn’t do my daily tasks or at least live the way I want to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot from this life lesson. Not because I was a brilliant, wise thinker. No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I felt that something wasn’t working — and I had a person who really was there and gave me the real talk that even shut me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having a person in your life — family member or friend — who can bring you back to your senses and logical mind? It’s a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end this blog here, I’ll just say:
I’ve learned the lesson and dis-attached myself from other people’s life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Episode. One Question. One Breath.</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/One-Episode-One-Question-One-Breath/</link>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this week’s blog post, I didn’t think that much as I always do. Because once I saw the episode of the show, I knew this is what my blog post will be about.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://youtu.be/7Ei_oa-vaJA?si=-5xGTZBiiPfJje6g&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Joe Rogan Experience #2312 - Jeremy Renner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me dive in straight away&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know there could be many people with a life story like this or even more heartache. But for me, this one really touched me. Just as these gentlemen ended their conversation, I say I appreciate both of you for bringing this to me. It resonated deep. Thank you &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was shocking to hear what happened to him. I remember the first thought that came to my mind — I felt that he was going to leave us. The other thing was that I didn’t want to hear anything about it, because it was painful when you’ve gone through the same experience with your own family. That made me very sad for his family — they were going to feel his absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after a while, I heard my brother saying that he is recovering. I said to myself… really? That is good news. I even checked Google for the news, and it was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that — maybe last year or the beginning of this year — I saw his appearance on&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://youtu.be/JN8E8HT3uiU?si=-C4S9qWgyvcjnelh&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Jeremy Renner on How His Near-Death Experience Changed His Outlook on Life (Extended)&lt;/a&gt; I hit &amp;ldquo;watch&amp;rdquo; immediately, and I felt blessed that he is back and alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when I finished the experience with Joe, I just want to say to Jeremy: (Thank you. I was hopeless).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his question: “What is the alternative?”
When Joe asked him how did you heal quickly, how do you keep a positive mindset, how did you get yourself out of the situation?
His answer was: “What’s the alternative?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I will give a moment to take My Next Breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who stumbles here to read my blog post, I have two things and I’ll end this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the question — in every aspect of your life that takes you to an uncertain future. This question will bring you back to the moment, since this is the only moment you have. It will also help you find the alternative, or to enjoy what you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the episode to bring yourself some logic and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take it easy, till next week. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Women Shouldn’t Lower Their Standards in Relationships</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/Why-Women-Shouldn%E2%80%99t-Lower-Their-Standards-in-Relationships/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 15:17:19 +0500</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/Why-Women-Shouldn%E2%80%99t-Lower-Their-Standards-in-Relationships/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0015.png" alt="Featured image of post Why Women Shouldn’t Lower Their Standards in Relationships" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I want to argue a point of view that I have been hearing a lot for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which is:&lt;/strong&gt; Women need to lower their standards, especially when it comes to relationships!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to suggest something to all the guys who say this and relationship coaches — especially: why don’t you say this instead? &amp;ldquo;Read Below.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you say to the guys who cannot find an understandable woman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be polite. No need for money or status — representing yourself with politeness is one way to get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humor is an amazing personality trait to have! But know how to use it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education degree is good, but if you have good understanding of your surroundings and how to utilize problem solving with critical thinking in a calm way, then I am sorry not sorry — put your degree in a cup of water and drink it. Maybe it will be useful. Hypothetically, a way to at least drink the knowledge since your brilliant mind could not have the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do work on upgrading your knowledge, and these days you have plenty of ways to do it. Read a book, watch documentaries, involve yourself in workshops, or learn a craft. Make yourself useful to her. I know people who have nothing to brag about except their good behavior and usefulness, and women agree on what they have. And I can see that she is way smarter than him, and I believe he knows it — yet he is not downsizing her. Instead, he is also using her knowledge for his life tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, guys, as you are asking for things, make sure you meet what she asks for! Because this is what made the standard higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girls, have your standard met. If he agrees and asks for time to meet your standard, understand him — give him time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean here by standards is not money, status, or fame. No, I mean behavior-wise, maturity, emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1- Tip: Ask her, who is your favorite actor? If she says anything about the character he played, listen to her — she is telling you about the way of treating her, okay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she said otherwise, then it is up to you if you want to stay or leave. She is materialistic if you are thinking to have an understanding one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- Tip: Watch this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406046/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13911628/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;series&lt;/a&gt;. Look please at what the male character did to show his usefulness and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Some People Shouldn’t Have Kids!</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/Why-Some-People-Shouldn%E2%80%99t-Have-Kids/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 19:36:23 +0500</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/Why-Some-People-Shouldn%E2%80%99t-Have-Kids/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0014.png" alt="Featured image of post Why Some People Shouldn’t Have Kids!" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know much about motherhood — but I do know it’s very hard.
In this blog post, I’ll try to explain where I stand on the matter, because for a long time, it has been one of my biggest fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I saw the difference between being just a parent-mother and being a real mother. A parent-mother only cares about bringing kids into the world. A mother, on the other hand, takes care of everything — from a child’s appearance to their inner emotional and mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After witnessing this contrast, I promised myself that I wouldn’t bring anyone into this world through me. Life continued to show me that parenting is not a game. And I believe these parent-mothers, who only focus on birthing children, often cause long-term harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when their kids grow up and start to wake up to reality, they go through grief — some break down, others spend years just trying to figure themselves out, usually without any healthy emotional tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few real-life examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to be okay with yourself: If your subconscious is wired to believe that you are the problem, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to understand and deal with fear: When your body and mind are used to living in constant fear, even peaceful moments feel like a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to trust yourself: This one is the hardest. You think you’ve faced the issue and solved it — but then something takes you back to square one, deeper into the original wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a life partner: You may meet the right person — but instead of building a calm future together, your unresolved wounds make the relationship full of unnecessary obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me define a few terms, from my point of view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parent-Mother: Someone only concerned with reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother: Someone who knows she can&amp;rsquo;t be everything, but chooses to seek help — from the father, grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, and uncles — to raise her child in a healthy way. By telling them her way some they can conturbite right. She focuses on understanding rather than always being right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for today. Just take it easy. 🌱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I couldn’t write a blog post — and somehow, it feels like a whole year has passed! But here I am, trying my best to talk about something. So bear with me in this one 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started. 😐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-points&#34;&gt;Main Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, my youngest brother — who was preparing to travel — finally did. And now, he’s no longer physically near me. Thankfully, we still connect through video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m so grateful for video calling. If we think about people during my grandfather’s time, they didn’t have this kind of technology. If I were in their place, the frustration and emptiness might’ve broken me completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, I had another brother who also moved away, and I didn’t feel this way when he left. This time it just hit hard. 💔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to meet him again soon, in good health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah… it’s taking time to feel “normal.” I’m doing my best to fill this emotional void with little things — daily routines, tasks, anything that makes me feel grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, I just want to say:
Family bonds are not easy to soothe. It takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not against a positive mindset, but for me, healing is a slow-cooking process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m giving myself the time I need — keeping up with the basics:
📚 Reading
🏃‍♀️ Working out
🚶‍♀️ Going for walks
🥗 Eating well
🌤️ Enjoying the weather&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take it easy — and happy weekend. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share what’s been happening over the past few weeks. To be honest, I’ve been focusing on things around me—nothing to worry about, just matters I needed to handle to maintain a calm mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in! 😃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-days-lately&#34;&gt;My Days Lately!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1️⃣ Starting My Online Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on launching my online business on Instagram! It’s focused on gift wrapping, and so far, I’ve been posting related content. It’s easy to manage, but I’m unsure whether I’ll continue. Let’s see what the future holds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2️⃣ A New Way of Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mhcreator.github.io/my-eleven-post/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Healing Through Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, one of the final chapters discussed an interesting concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💭 Questioning the way we think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, it’s about being critical of our own thought patterns—challenging why our minds think in a certain way and questioning our assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is a new idea, but I can’t recall where I first encountered it. What I liked about this approach is that if I apply it, it could act as a form of self-therapy, helping me surface the root of my emotions. Maybe it could even help me become more patient and less impulsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3️⃣ Watching a Historical TV Show&lt;/strong&gt;
I’ve been watching an Arabic-Islamic TV series about Muawiyah Bin Abi Sufyan, a historical figure. I haven’t finished it yet, but it’s fascinating! Once I’m done, I’ll share my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4️⃣ A Tough Emotional Shift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest things I’ve been dealing with is change within the family. My younger brother has left home to focus on his future, and it’s a new emotional experience for me. Of course, I want the best for him, but it’s still tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I try to stay positive, I still struggle to fully accept it. Instead of overthinking, I try to focus on the present moment. With time, things will settle, and life will feel normal again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading Healing Through Philosophy has given me new perspectives on dealing with emotions and changes in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I’ll remind myself to take it easy—and I hope you do too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, &lt;strong&gt;MH ✨&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s the Point of Living? – A Follow-up with Philosophy</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0011.png" alt="Featured image of post What’s the Point of Living? – A Follow-up with Philosophy" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching to a Saturday Blog!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to change my weekly blog from Friday to Saturday, simply because that&amp;rsquo;s what has been happening naturally for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s blog is one of the possible answers to the question I asked last week: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mhcreator.github.io/my-ten-post/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;What Is the Point of Living?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;healing-through-philosophy---التداوي-بالفلسفة&#34;&gt;Healing Through Philosophy - التداوي بالفلسفة
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book was a recommendation from an influencer I follow. Interestingly, when I studied Philosophy in university, I didn’t enjoy it much and barely remember what it was about. So, before even starting this book, I was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually searching for another book, but since I couldn’t find it in PDF format, I decided to give Healing Through Philosophy (التداوي بالفلسفة) a try. I had time to read while waiting for my brother at the dentist. T_T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📖 Note: The book is in Arabic (my native language). I’m not sure if it’s available in English or other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, Saeed Nashid, did an amazing job using his own insights combined with ideas from notable philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chapter That Got Me: &amp;ldquo;Maybe We Don&amp;rsquo;t Need Hope&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, Nashid references a story from The Book of Samuel II (Old Testament) about Prophet David and how he reacted when his son (before Solomon) was ill and later died. His followers were surprised by his shift in emotions—from distress to calmness. He explained that once his son passed away, he no longer had to witness his suffering. Instead, he found comfort in knowing that he would reunite with him in the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophical idea here is how hope can be a double-edged sword—it can motivate us, but it can also cause emotional suffering when things don’t turn out as we expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also references Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Baruch Spinoza. Nietzsche, for example, pointed out that the ancient Greeks believed hope was the greatest evil—because it keeps people waiting instead of acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Thoughts on Hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter hit me because nowadays, &amp;ldquo;hope&amp;rdquo; is marketed everywhere—in self-help books, social media, and even corporate culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in reality, hope alone is not enough. Life isn’t a movie where everything magically works out. Most of our days are filled with routine, boredom, and occasional happiness—and too much hope can lead to disappointment when things don’t happen as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book gave me one possible answer to last week’s question. It presents a lifestyle perspective, where people try to define meaning in every aspect of life—whether it’s happiness, career, love, or marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helped me understand how ideas evolve over time—how people in the past thought vs. how modern society thinks today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s my struggle:
There are so many concepts in philosophy, and after understanding them, I have to decide how to apply them in my own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is short—so if you find it in your language, I highly recommend reading it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week, just take it easy. 😊&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Is the Point of Living? A Thoughtful Reflection</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/What-Is-the-Point-of-Living-A-Thoughtful-Reflection/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 21:16:14 +0500</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/What-Is-the-Point-of-Living-A-Thoughtful-Reflection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0010.png" alt="Featured image of post What Is the Point of Living? A Thoughtful Reflection" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t write a blog last week because I was under the weather, struggling with seasonal flu. It wasn’t pleasant at all. I keep wondering—why does this happen? When I was younger and living in a different geographic location, I never experienced this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after moving to a new place, it started happening, and each time, it hit me hard. For years, I made sure to get a flu shot annually. However, last year, I thought, let me skip it and see what happens. Well, turns out, I couldn’t handle it. So, on Tuesday, I finally got the flu shot, and I’ve been feeling much better in the past couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my little update, but now, let’s get into the real topic of this blog—something that’s been on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-point-of-living-or-having-a-life&#34;&gt;What Is the Point Of Living? or Having a Life?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why, but this question keeps looping in my mind, especially when I’m sick. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time it struck me—it was in my last year of high school. I kept thinking, No matter how long you live or how much you try to achieve, eventually, you’ll end up in the grave. So what’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I was feeling down at the time because my educational path wasn’t clear. But even now, after finishing university, I still ask myself the same question. Sure, completing my degree made me happy, but did it dramatically change my life? Not really. It gave me some direction, like my goal to study abroad, but even if that doesn’t happen, life will just keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at it from another angle—marriage or work. We chase after them, but once we have them, they come with their own struggles. Being single or a freelancer isn’t necessarily easier; you become your own judge and prisoner to your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even having dreams and goals can feel heavy. When they don’t work out, you feel crushed. And when they do, sometimes they don’t bring the satisfaction you expected. So, what’s the point? Life will go on, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So!!! What is what matters for reall?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly? I don’t know. Some say it’s about the emotions you experience—they change you. But even if you change, life itself doesn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before anyone worries—no, I don’t have any intentions of ending my life, nor do I have any known mental health issues. I’m just asking a question that I think many people ask themselves at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not looking for an answer, because honestly, anyone who claims to have one is probably lying. Instead, I think the real challenge is finding a way to keep moving forward while still trying to make sense of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s just take it easy—until next time. ✌️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Life Update: Scholarship Paperwork, 3D Art &amp; Getting Ready for Ramadan</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/Blog-Post-About-Life-Update/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0009.png" alt="Featured image of post Life Update: Scholarship Paperwork, 3D Art &amp; Getting Ready for Ramadan" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, I know exactly what I want to talk about&amp;hellip; HEHEHEHE! 😆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason behind that? Well, I couldn’t do anything about AI Testing as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no worries! Life doesn’t always go as I want, so I just had to go with the flow. Meow 🐱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heres-why&#34;&gt;Here’s Why!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to finish the paperwork for a Korean Scholarship—it was a lot! Four sets of documents, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I helped prepare gifts for my lovely dad’s friends. He wanted to gift them dates and Zamzam water so they could break their fast during Ramadan, which starts on Sunday, March 2nd. I truly enjoyed the process of preparing these gifts. 🎁✨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I started creating a 3D model based on one of my old 2D drawings! This is the first time I’m creating something from scratch without following a tutorial. It’s making me realize that I can do it—there’s no need to be afraid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I still forget things like hotkeys, but thankfully, Blender’s guide and past tutorials are really helping me, especially with texturing and render settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other than that&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramadan is starting tomorrow, and thanks to my mindful family, we’ve already agreed to keep things simple. No unnecessary stress, especially when it comes to food!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our rule? Keep it minimal. Just two samosas each and soup is a must! 🍲&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I promised myself that I’d post a blog every week, so here I am keeping that promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just a brief update about my week—so remember, just take it easy! 😊&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Interest In AI Marketing: The Perfect Blend of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Digital Strategy</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/My-Interest-In-AI-Marketing/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:57:12 +0500</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/My-Interest-In-AI-Marketing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0008.png" alt="Featured image of post My Interest In AI Marketing: The Perfect Blend of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Digital Strategy" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I start thinking about what to write for this week&amp;rsquo;s blog post, all ideas seem to run away, leaving me with an empty head and struggling to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just talk about what I found fascinating this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) Marketing as a field of study. 🤩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know that feeling when you&amp;rsquo;re searching for something you genuinely enjoy? Well, I finally found it! I’ve been on a mission to discover a field that combines AI and Marketing, specifically Digital Marketing, and I came across it at Busan University of Foreign Studies – Artificial Intelligence Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this gem while browsing the university’s overview PDF, and let me tell you—I was beyond excited! 😳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field brings together everything I enjoy: AI, Languages, and Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working in social media marketing, I often used AI for content creation, and honestly, it was a game-changer! Crafting the right prompts, experimenting with AI-generated content, and refining strategies with my team was such an engaging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would share prompts, analyze AI-generated responses, and study different resources to improve our results. The collaboration was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But There Was a Downside&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI sometimes started acting different. 😅 Maybe it was because I wasn’t using the paid version, or perhaps my prompts weren’t structured well! IDK for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, the AI-generated content felt repetitive, overly philosophical, or too academic—which isn’t ideal for social media marketing. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms cater to everyone—from highly educated professionals to casual users. Our job as marketers is to deliver clear, engaging, and easy-to-understand content that drives action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our writing is too complex, or if our graphics/videos are overloaded with information, they won’t work—except maybe for Japanese audiences (check the link to know why 🧐). And I want to really use their way of desgining, I&amp;rsquo;ll share when I&amp;rsquo;ll use it and how sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is: Keep it simple, clear, and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-like-it&#34;&gt;Why I Like It?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why do I find this field so exciting? Here are my reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ It feels like I’m training something &amp;lt; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can call it device the AI&amp;gt; the language of how to understand &amp;amp; communicate better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ Languages fascinate me! I recently heard someone point out something interesting which I know but was not present in my mind: English assigns (She/He when talking about Woman/Man), just like Japanese and Arabic, but Urdu doesn’t &amp;ldquo;آپ (Ap)&amp;rdquo; is used for both genders! 🤯
I beleive there are other languages, I&amp;rsquo;ll check it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ I already have experience in digital marketing, so I know this field would be amazing to study!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also checked out the course curriculum, and it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for! There’s &amp;ldquo;Introduction to AI Marketing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Digital Platform Marketing.&amp;rdquo; The first one, in particular, has me hooked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, training AI to understand different languages and cultural nuances sounds like an incredible challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, I’m applying to Busan University of Foreign Studies – Artificial Intelligence Marketing, and I’ll be looking for similar programs in other universities as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And until I get accepted into one, I plan to experiment with AI to train it in the Urdu language and of course, I’ll share everything here.!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till then, take it easy! ✌️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Artistic Path! Blender, Social Media, and Self-Doubt</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/My-Artistic-Path!-Blender,-Social-Media,-and-Self-Doubt/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 20:45:31 +0500</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/My-Artistic-Path!-Blender,-Social-Media,-and-Self-Doubt/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0007.png" alt="Featured image of post My Artistic Path! Blender, Social Media, and Self-Doubt" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;People pleasing planet got a million people saying how to plan it&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Imagine Dragons&amp;rdquo;. I am vibing with their song today. 🎧♫♪♫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, today&amp;rsquo;s weather was nice; windy + the sun shone brightly with a pinch of clouds and flowers starting to bloom again. &amp;ldquo;Grateful Face&amp;rdquo;☀️🌾🤗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actully, I am struggling with what to write for this blog! I was thinking of writing about my favorite anime! But no it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a lot and I feel tired now, maybe because of I just had my dinner.🥱😴&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this blog post will be about pursuing my creative passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-did-grow-on-me&#34;&gt;How It did Grow on me!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning 3D art with Blender beginning was the Donut tutorial from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Blender Guru&lt;/a&gt;. I remember working on it for the first time and was around 2020 since I was unemployed hehe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honestly, I wanted this time to last forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you know we humans are a very difficult species! Or maybe it is just me.
I felt unhonest. Like it is a lie I&amp;rsquo;m telling to myself, that being an digital artist is not my interest. Literally, this is what I told myself that I was just going to use my free time in this, and I&amp;rsquo;ll apply for real jobs like the one that was in my mind Content Writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;guess-what-&#34;&gt;Guess What! 😔
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I believe 6 months of creating 3D models with Blender, I have stopped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing about this now makes me realize the heartache. Because.. yeah when I started the job I was into it, to know all the ins and outs then shifted to another position as a Social Media Executive. This position too got me excited to work with dynamic creative writing with social media, I was fascinatie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, doing all by being busy with work and my studies, I still felt the urge that I was doing something wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s not what I wanted to do. And from all the things I was interested in, my interest in 3D did not die. I was following the Blender Guru newsletter and following **&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.blender.org/features/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt;**news always checking out their yearly event for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up this Blog, I am going to say two things to overcoming self-doubt in creativity. 😎👌🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, don&amp;rsquo;t you ever leave yourself without an interest, and if you find it &lt;strong&gt;Do Not&lt;/strong&gt; let yourself foul you. That it&amp;rsquo;s not what you are supposed to do, I am still trying to stop myself! Even after I made up my mind that this is what I want to be doing till I leave this earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dont miss this sign; if you are feeling happy while doing it.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep doing it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I have an account on Instagram, which I intend to share my beginner&amp;rsquo;s journey in digital art in 2D and intermediate in 3D. As I left my last job position as assistant manager in the Social Media Team, I thought doing social media for yourself was really easy. No, it&amp;rsquo;s not, even with experience in social media, becasue I can be lazy. &amp;ldquo;I try my best&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this time I leave you with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“ If you hear a voice within you say you cannot paint, then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced.” ― Van Gogh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to start this blog post! But in this blog post, I want to share about the scholarships that I am applying for to achieve my Dream of Studying in Japan for my higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-story-with-japanese-scholarships&#34;&gt;My Story with Japanese Scholarships!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started applying last year to any opportunity I could find&amp;hellip; and I have started with the most popular MEXT scholarship journey began with embassy track! I passed the exam section, and the interview section, but then not accepted with the nomination section of MEXT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not feel tearful when it happened because it&amp;rsquo;s scholarships and the count of people who were is many. And there was the university track! Yet, I remember telling myself, that I must have said something in the interview or maybe because my Japanese Language was beginner since I could not attend the exam accurately. Or it could be that they do not accept my field of study&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not make any difference at the end of the day I had to just take it easy and do what I had to do. I&amp;rsquo;ll apply for this year also when it opens..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University track&lt;/strong&gt; was no good also!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the field they were offering the scholarship was not my study field. I did my search and looked for universities that can offer the field and the scholarship and I did the second part of e-mailing the professor&amp;hellip; got one response who told me he is retiring and can&amp;rsquo;t have me; the other no reply till now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am not complaining I am stating the facts only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;
Yesterday that date 5/2/2025 morning I had another inconsolable news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After, my ADB-JSP scholarship experience started! This scholarship had a condition that I was aware of but I did not remember &amp;lsquo;my bad&amp;rsquo;, which was to have 2 years at least after graduation, they don&amp;rsquo;t count life time work experience&amp;hellip; which is very depressing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the terms and conditions but, I wonder what kind of term is this?? Why what different it is going to make having prior or post experience? I want to know if there is a reason behind this since most of the study abroad scholarship have it. I was deman ready and felt that this time I&amp;rsquo;d have it. Literally, everything was going smoothly and all documents were up and ready, guess it was not the right time for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclution&#34;&gt;Conclution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just needed to share this here Hopefully someday I&amp;rsquo;ll have the answer! Maybe when the moment comes for me; this will be proof for me that everyone will get through. Also, I hope this helps somebody if face my situation. What makes me go through it.. is having a family, not any family a family that makes whatever in mind smaller and you can do it to a 3000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as it is still new to overcoming this scholarship rejections I am taking it easy and I&amp;rsquo;ll take my time to apply for other scholarships. Since my goal is to complete my studies abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For next week&amp;rsquo;s blog.. I change the topic to a career perspective. Cause if I let this go on it will end it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/How-Anime-Inspired-My-Passion-for-the-Japanese-Language-%7C-Part-2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0005.png" alt="Featured image of post How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language | Part 2" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the background of How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share the resources that helped me learn the Japanese language for the self-study method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my N5 test result&amp;hellip; I got the result today morning 31 Jan 2025. And why I am doing the JLPT exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;resourses-to-help-study-japanese&#34;&gt;Resourses to help study Japanese:
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, as I begin to check what are the best resources for self-study or is good to just find a course online or attend a language course at a campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the latter since the first takes a lot to explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For face-to-face campus:&lt;/strong&gt;
There is an amazing university called &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.numl.edu.pk/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;NUML University&lt;/a&gt;, this uni specializes in Languages there are almost all languages that a person interested in can learn, and they provide various levels starting with certificates to diplomas also, some have Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees and few have Master Degree. But first, check their website to know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it came to me, their times were not suitable for me because I was working. So, I said let me try self-study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self Study:&lt;/strong&gt;
I did my first online course for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://minato-jf.jp/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Japanese Language&lt;/a&gt; I did Marugoto for a while. Eventually, I decided last year in July that I would do the JLPT Exam, yet I was confused between N5 and N4 since N3 I felt there was a lot on me. In the end, my decision was N5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have missed the date for July 2024. I had to wait and apply for the Des 2024 Test. This gives me like 6 months to really prepare for the first time. I planned to check some videos on Youtube by people who have taken the exam, to create my plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a Study Book, I have picked from the two famous books Ginki and &lt;strong&gt;Mina no Nihon Go&lt;/strong&gt; the latter. The Study book had everything but, I have put all the required Kanji for N5 in a section in my copy so I can memorize them in my free time, a section for every lesson grammar, and a section for vocabulary with answering book questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to study for 4 hours but to behonest life won&amp;rsquo;t relieve you for it grap so when I could not I had to make up time to waste hours. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the whole book before the exam, I have just finished 5 first lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not focus on writing much and speaking since these skills are not tested in the exam, it&amp;rsquo;s a Muiltbull choice question, for Reading, Grammar, vocabulary, and lastly Listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; You can enhance your skills of speaking and writing if you wish when preparing for the exam but you need to put extra time and effort. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t because my life experience is different from you all, and I respect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please find the Links to resources in the &lt;strong&gt;Links Section&lt;/strong&gt; I used to help me study the language on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after I have given you some brief about my studying plan I still choose learning by myself for my N3 JLPT. My reason for studying Japanese it may sound silly but I want to watch anime without subtitles and as I am trying to find an opportunity to complete my higher studies in Japan, I want to be comfortable with the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My result of the 1st Des 2024 Exam as shown, it shows that I did not pass! But considering everything I have mentioned above, I see an achievement and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bring the maximum score I want the passing which is 80. Yet, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have them this time.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, My plan now is to prepare for N3 as I have a whole year to prepare for the exam. And if I did not pass that one I&amp;rsquo;ll repeat it till I get the passing score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0004.png" alt="Featured image of post How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the topic, today&amp;rsquo;s blog is about Using entertainment for language skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I remember!😇 After high school I was easily taking my life, cause all I knew back then was that my life hit a dead wall for some reason I will keep off this time, to focus on today&amp;rsquo;s topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around 2011 and 2012 or maybe 2013, when I had one main idea in my mind which was how I can develop my language skills. My main focus was the English Language because my mother tongue wasn&amp;rsquo;t English.😏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the resources to help myself find new vocals; there were English songs and TV series! But what was on TV I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it!🥸 Because the Internet had amazing options like a series called Supernatural, Sam was my favorite! I saw the first of two seasons on TV and when I checked the Internet they were during the 3rd or 4th season, I needed to catch on&amp;hellip;😎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, back then I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about torrents!😁 The websites I had were paid to watch not free &amp;ldquo;I know nothing is supposed to be free for copywrites&amp;rdquo;. But It&amp;rsquo;s not me it was away at that time and it was normal at the time. Also, there were some illegal websites for a person like me who could not pay to watch for free&amp;hellip;.!😮‍💨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bummer was they did not have American series they had &lt;strong&gt;Korean drama, Japanese drama, and Anime!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-is-how-everything-started&#34;&gt;Here Is How Everything Started!😳
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began watching first with Korean Drama; Coffee Prince my all-time favorite. Then Boys Before Flowers&amp;hellip; and some that I don&amp;rsquo;t remember now. It helped me gain new words every day cause Korean I wasn&amp;rsquo;t understand so, I checked the subtitles to know what happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really helped me be good at Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading: I had to read the subtitles to understand what was happening. Any word I did not know I used to ask my cousin and the early Google translator which use to suck. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember using a dictionary&amp;hellip; hmmm I don&amp;rsquo;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing: taking up words and writing them on my notes was that was all. And I used to use them in writing on my FB Page, massaging my friends &amp;hellip; that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking: I begin using them with my own language! This helped me know how to pronounce it correctly. It got me some laughs on but no worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening: this was tricky since by listening to Korean a lot I really became familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brilliant Idea Come-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t I start also learning Korean! I&amp;rsquo;ll hit two birds with one stone since learning languages has become my goal. And I did it and started learning the alphabet and watching. I kept doing this for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my friend N &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;her name starts with N&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, to avoid any confusion. She told me to watch an anime with her and I did not resist yet, I welcomed the idea. Gosick was the one I began with my friend watching the anime. After that, I am still watching anime. I started loving Japan, Japanese culture, and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-think-ending-this-blog-here-is-a-good-idea&#34;&gt;I Think Ending This Blog Here, Is A Good Idea!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fancy kind of story is here.🤭 I can proudly say that I have passed my IELTS exam with a very pleasant mark and I did my N5 first JLPT exam on Dec 2024; still waiting for the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can have another special blog on My favorite anime, How I prepare for the N5 JLPT exam, and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll share my IELTS success story! I may share my own tips for learning languages as self-study.And the best resources that I used from ppl I saw as experts in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, till next Friday, take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>http://localhost:1313/Who-am-I-and-What-I-want-to-Do/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:50:59 +0500</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/Who-am-I-and-What-I-want-to-Do/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0003.png" alt="Featured image of post Who am I? Why! and What I want to Do" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;who&#34;&gt;Who!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 13 years of working a job, freelance, then changing locations another corporate job, getting fired for the first time, and a new job, another new job. And I quit. My mindset become clear to start building a personal brand for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Away for my personal growth journey, I am Maha, 32 years old. Living on earth in a country name Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above what I think good experience from my working life. I have decided to do what I used to do to grow other people&amp;rsquo;s brands, clients, and companies. I want to use my talents and skills for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First I want to create a showcase from myself to everyone else who is hesitating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it git to bad idea then, it’s proof to myself that I Fucked up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s Now or Later Not now or never. But I decided for now to do IT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-want-to-do&#34;&gt;What I want To do!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said it earlier in my first post, but here I want to specify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a webpage with Hugo themes and Github. Checked it ^ this was like going through hell, gladly I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start Digital drawing and manga creation. Post about my leveling up here too, or maybe open a Youtube channel!! I still don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two freelance brands one is in Photography and the other is making candles. In photography, I have a ground to stand on but candles going to be new. So I need to build it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the last, I like learning new cultures and languages so I am doing Japanese now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I don’t know what I’ll have as an interest in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know having multitasking with multiple interests is not a good idea! Yet, being inspiraed by Elon Musk, as he go&amp;rsquo;s through different companies in one day, motivated me. So, I’m not him I can not do all in one day, instead, I’ll do is to give all the needed time for one thing in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Priorities are, Learning Japanese for JLPT/N3 before upcoming July 2025 for like 1-2 hours a day. I can also have another thing like drawing since my first drawing table will arrive today Saturday 18, 2025, to give 2-3 hours is doable too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I make sure to have a separate blog post for each thing I mentioned above, to give a background and share the present and future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0002.png" alt="Featured image of post Hugo Theme Stack Is Getting Me Fusturated!!!!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s get into it..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had my time trying to find what is the issue!! (like around 3 days).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-nothing-happen-as-i-wanted&#34;&gt;But nothing happen as I wanted!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I am no developer or programmer, but I really wanted to create a website with the most easy way with an #OpenSourceTools. Plus, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use drag and drop websites cause I want to gain a bit knowledge how websites work. I have been struggling over the past year to create my website with #HugoStack; time was not on my side becasue of work and studies. I needed to be focused and free which is exactly what I have now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for my awesome luck, I have a brother who knows things about creating website and coding, he was the one who told me about github and hugo. &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t say much, but he takes a bit of credit for helping me with this :P&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue was that I needed to covert YAML to TOML, and guess what happens when this saying describes you correctly. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;You Know Nothing John Snow&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. Yet, when I was trying I used the same solution my bro did, but it did not work with me as always he has the magical touch :/ of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, from him I&amp;rsquo;ve heard! That YAML and TOML are everyone&amp;rsquo;s headache; I am not the only one. But me happily and with my bro aid, &lt;strong&gt;my website is ready and good to go.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(about, archive, and coffee me page) in the main sidebar was not apperaring on my localhost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidebar pic was not apperaring also!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[menu]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[menu.social]]
    identifier= &#39;youtube&#39;
    name= &#39;YouTube&#39;
    weight= 1
    url= &#39;&#39;

    [menu.social.params]
        icon= &#39;youtube&#39;
        
        [[menu.main]]
    identifier= &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;
    name= &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot;
    url= &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;
    weight= -3
    pre= &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;

    [menu.main.params]
        ### For demonstration purpose, the home link will be open in a new tab
        newTab= false 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sidebar pic to show up use this path and save the pic in this dirctory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ /home/user/Desktop/blog/yoursitename/themes/hugo-theme-stack/assets/img ]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example to anyone who is suffering like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all, have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/0001.png" alt="Featured image of post My First Post" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since covid..
I have been thinking about quitting my job!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these moments when it hits you feel like you are a dreamer or a fairy tail (you wonder why this idea is happening in your mind? Why do you even feel this way?) and fear comes to take the courage aways. So I convinced myself that I can do it, while working and studying. For a fact I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do, since “Burnout is real”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there are other personal responsibilities, personal care, and friends time weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on Nov-2024 I quit the job and I am thinking of doing the things that were hunting my mind when I was working. Like blogging, creating a brand, and digital drawing. To be honest fear is eating my head about not achieving the goal or it might be a studpied idea… but the relief I’m feeling makes me like the idea of keeping it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Let me see what I can do till 2025 finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
