[{"content":"Intro From the topic, today\u0026rsquo;s blog is about Using entertainment for language skills\nAs I remember!😇 After high school I was easily taking my life, cause all I knew back then was that my life hit a dead wall for some reason I will keep off this time, to focus on today\u0026rsquo;s topic.\nIt was around 2011 and 2012 or maybe 2013, when I had one main idea in my mind which was how I can develop my language skills. My main focus was the English Language because my mother tongue wasn\u0026rsquo;t English.😏\nTo find the resources to help myself find new vocals; there were English songs and TV series! But what was on TV I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it!🥸 Because the Internet had amazing options like a series called Supernatural, Sam was my favorite! I saw the first of two seasons on TV and when I checked the Internet they were during the 3rd or 4th season, I needed to catch on\u0026hellip;😎\nYet, back then I didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about torrents!😁 The websites I had were paid to watch not free \u0026ldquo;I know nothing is supposed to be free for copywrites\u0026rdquo;. But It\u0026rsquo;s not me it was away at that time and it was normal at the time. Also, there were some illegal websites for a person like me who could not pay to watch for free\u0026hellip;.!😮‍💨\nThe bummer was they did not have American series they had Korean drama, Japanese drama, and Anime!!!!!\nHere Is How Everything Started!😳 I began watching first with Korean Drama; Coffee Prince my all-time favorite. Then Boys Before Flowers\u0026hellip; and some that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember now. It helped me gain new words every day cause Korean I wasn\u0026rsquo;t understand so, I checked the subtitles to know what happening.\nThis really helped me be good at Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening;\nReading: I had to read the subtitles to understand what was happening. Any word I did not know I used to ask my cousin and the early Google translator which use to suck. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember using a dictionary\u0026hellip; hmmm I don\u0026rsquo;t remember.\nWriting: taking up words and writing them on my notes was that was all. And I used to use them in writing on my FB Page, massaging my friends \u0026hellip; that was it.\nSpeaking: I begin using them with my own language! This helped me know how to pronounce it correctly. It got me some laughs on but no worries.\nListening: this was tricky since by listening to Korean a lot I really became familiar with it.\nA Brilliant Idea Come-up\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t I start also learning Korean! I\u0026rsquo;ll hit two birds with one stone since learning languages has become my goal. And I did it and started learning the alphabet and watching. I kept doing this for a while.\nThen my friend N \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;her name starts with N\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;, to avoid any confusion. She told me to watch an anime with her and I did not resist yet, I welcomed the idea. Gosick was the one I began with my friend watching the anime. After that, I am still watching anime. I started loving Japan, Japanese culture, and language.\nI Think Ending This Blog Here, Is A Good Idea! This fancy kind of story is here.🤭 I can proudly say that I have passed my IELTS exam with a very pleasant mark and I did my N5 first JLPT exam on Dec 2024; still waiting for the results.\nI can have another special blog on My favorite anime, How I prepare for the N5 JLPT exam, and maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll share my IELTS success story! I may share my own tips for learning languages as self-study.And the best resources that I used from ppl I saw as experts in it.\nSo, till next Friday, take it easy.\nLinks 📬 Email Me ☕ Coffee Me ","date":"2025-01-23T16:52:13+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0004.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-forth-post/","title":"How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language"},{"content":"Who! After 13 years of working a job, freelance, then changing locations another corporate job, getting fired for the first time, and a new job, another new job. And I quit. My mindset become clear to start building a personal brand for myself.\nAway for my personal growth journey, I am Maha, 32 years old. Living on earth in a country name Pakistan.\nWhy! As I mentioned above what I think good experience from my working life. I have decided to do what I used to do to grow other people\u0026rsquo;s brands, clients, and companies. I want to use my talents and skills for myself.\nWhy!\nFirst I want to create a showcase from myself to everyone else who is hesitating. If it git to bad idea then, it’s proof to myself that I Fucked up. It’s Now or Later Not now or never. But I decided for now to do IT. What I want To do! I said it earlier in my first post, but here I want to specify it.\nMy Plan:\nCreate a webpage with Hugo themes and Github. Checked it ^ this was like going through hell, gladly I did it.\nI want to start Digital drawing and manga creation. Post about my leveling up here too, or maybe open a Youtube channel!! I still don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nI have two freelance brands one is in Photography and the other is making candles. In photography, I have a ground to stand on but candles going to be new. So I need to build it correctly.\nBefore the last, I like learning new cultures and languages so I am doing Japanese now.\nLastly, I don’t know what I’ll have as an interest in the future.\nConclusion I know having multitasking with multiple interests is not a good idea! Yet, being inspiraed by Elon Musk, as he go\u0026rsquo;s through different companies in one day, motivated me. So, I’m not him I can not do all in one day, instead, I’ll do is to give all the needed time for one thing in time.\nMy Priorities are, Learning Japanese for JLPT/N3 before upcoming July 2025 for like 1-2 hours a day. I can also have another thing like drawing since my first drawing table will arrive today Saturday 18, 2025, to give 2-3 hours is doable too.\nFinally, I make sure to have a separate blog post for each thing I mentioned above, to give a background and share the present and future perspectives.\nLink ☕ Coffee Me ","date":"2025-01-17T17:50:59+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0003.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-third-post/","title":"Who am I? Why! and What I want to Do"},{"content":"Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s get into it..\nI had my time trying to find what is the issue!! (like around 3 days).\nBut nothing happen as I wanted! To be honest, I am no developer or programmer, but I really wanted to create a website with the most easy way with an #OpenSourceTools. Plus, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to use drag and drop websites cause I want to gain a bit knowledge how websites work. I have been struggling over the past year to create my website with #HugoStack; time was not on my side becasue of work and studies. I needed to be focused and free which is exactly what I have now.\nAnd for my awesome luck, I have a brother who knows things about creating website and coding, he was the one who told me about github and hugo. \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t say much, but he takes a bit of credit for helping me with this :P\u0026rdquo;.\nThe issue was that I needed to covert YAML to TOML, and guess what happens when this saying describes you correctly. \u0026ldquo;You Know Nothing John Snow\u0026rdquo;. Yet, when I was trying I used the same solution my bro did, but it did not work with me as always he has the magical touch :/ of coding.\nAlso, from him I\u0026rsquo;ve heard! That YAML and TOML are everyone\u0026rsquo;s headache; I am not the only one. But me happily and with my bro aid, my website is ready and good to go.\nThe Problem: (about, archive, and coffee me page) in the main sidebar was not apperaring on my localhost.\nSidebar pic was not apperaring also!\nThe Solution: [menu]\n[[menu.social]] identifier= 'youtube' name= 'YouTube' weight= 1 url= '' [menu.social.params] icon= 'youtube' [[menu.main]] identifier= \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; name= \u0026quot;Home\u0026quot; url= \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; weight= -3 pre= \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; [menu.main.params] ### For demonstration purpose, the home link will be open in a new tab newTab= false For sidebar pic to show up use this path and save the pic in this dirctory.\n[ /home/user/Desktop/blog/yoursitename/themes/hugo-theme-stack/assets/img ]\nThis is an example to anyone who is suffering like me.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all, have fun.\nUseful-Links ☕ Coffee Me 📽 Creating a Blog with Hugo and Github in 10 minutes\n","date":"2025-01-10T18:03:11+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0002.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-second-post/","title":"Hugo Theme Stack Is Getting Me Fusturated!!!!"},{"content":"Since covid.. I have been thinking about quitting my job!!\nBut these moments when it hits you feel like you are a dreamer or a fairy tail (you wonder why this idea is happening in your mind? Why do you even feel this way?) and fear comes to take the courage aways. So I convinced myself that I can do it, while working and studying. For a fact I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do, since “Burnout is real”.\nBecause there are other personal responsibilities, personal care, and friends time weekly.\nSo, on Nov-2024 I quit the job and I am thinking of doing the things that were hunting my mind when I was working. Like blogging, creating a brand, and digital drawing. To be honest fear is eating my head about not achieving the goal or it might be a studpied idea… but the relief I’m feeling makes me like the idea of keeping it up.\nTherefore, Let me see what I can do till 2025 finishes.\nLinks ☕ Coffee Me ","date":"2025-01-08T14:18:06+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0001.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/slug/","title":"My First Post"}]
