[{"content":"Intro To be honest I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to start this blog post! But in this blog post, I want to share about the scholarships that I am applying for to achieve my Dream of Studying in Japan for my higher education.\nMy Story with Japanese Scholarships! I started applying last year to any opportunity I could find\u0026hellip; and I have started with the most popular MEXT scholarship journey began with embassy track! I passed the exam section, and the interview section, but then not accepted with the nomination section of MEXT.\nI did not feel tearful when it happened because it\u0026rsquo;s scholarships and the count of people who were is many. And there was the university track! Yet, I remember telling myself, that I must have said something in the interview or maybe because my Japanese Language was beginner since I could not attend the exam accurately. Or it could be that they do not accept my field of study\u0026hellip;\nIt does not make any difference at the end of the day I had to just take it easy and do what I had to do. I\u0026rsquo;ll apply for this year also when it opens..\nUniversity track was no good also!\nBecause the field they were offering the scholarship was not my study field. I did my search and looked for universities that can offer the field and the scholarship and I did the second part of e-mailing the professor\u0026hellip; got one response who told me he is retiring and can\u0026rsquo;t have me; the other no reply till now!\nHere I am not complaining I am stating the facts only.\nNext Yesterday that date 5/2/2025 morning I had another inconsolable news!\nAfter, my ADB-JSP scholarship experience started! This scholarship had a condition that I was aware of but I did not remember \u0026lsquo;my bad\u0026rsquo;, which was to have 2 years at least after graduation, they don\u0026rsquo;t count life time work experience\u0026hellip; which is very depressing!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t mind the terms and conditions but, I wonder what kind of term is this?? Why what different it is going to make having prior or post experience? I want to know if there is a reason behind this since most of the study abroad scholarship have it. I was deman ready and felt that this time I\u0026rsquo;d have it. Literally, everything was going smoothly and all documents were up and ready, guess it was not the right time for me.\nConclution I just needed to share this here Hopefully someday I\u0026rsquo;ll have the answer! Maybe when the moment comes for me; this will be proof for me that everyone will get through. Also, I hope this helps somebody if face my situation. What makes me go through it.. is having a family, not any family a family that makes whatever in mind smaller and you can do it to a 3000 times.\nBut as it is still new to overcoming this scholarship rejections I am taking it easy and I\u0026rsquo;ll take my time to apply for other scholarships. Since my goal is to complete my studies abroad.\nFor next week\u0026rsquo;s blog.. I change the topic to a career perspective. Cause if I let this go on it will end it.\nLinks üì¨ Email Me ‚òï Coffee Me üåê List for N5 Kanji ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Mina no Nihon GO Book ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Memorise Kanji üåê Japanese Short Stories Free ","date":"2025-02-06T17:00:13+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0006.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-sixth-post/","title":"How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language | Part 3"},{"content":"Intro After the background of How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language. In this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ll share the resources that helped me learn the Japanese language for the self-study method.\nAt the end of this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my N5 test result\u0026hellip; I got the result today morning 31 Jan 2025. And why I am doing the JLPT exam.\nResourses to help study Japanese: Actually, as I begin to check what are the best resources for self-study or is good to just find a course online or attend a language course at a campus.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start with the latter since the first takes a lot to explain:\nFor face-to-face campus: There is an amazing university called NUML University, this uni specializes in Languages there are almost all languages that a person interested in can learn, and they provide various levels starting with certificates to diplomas also, some have Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degrees and few have Master Degree. But first, check their website to know more.\nBut when it came to me, their times were not suitable for me because I was working. So, I said let me try self-study.\nSelf Study: I did my first online course for Japanese Language I did Marugoto for a while. Eventually, I decided last year in July that I would do the JLPT Exam, yet I was confused between N5 and N4 since N3 I felt there was a lot on me. In the end, my decision was N5.\nSo, I have missed the date for July 2024. I had to wait and apply for the Des 2024 Test. This gives me like 6 months to really prepare for the first time. I planned to check some videos on Youtube by people who have taken the exam, to create my plan:\nFind a Study Book, I have picked from the two famous books Ginki and Mina no Nihon Go the latter. The Study book had everything but, I have put all the required Kanji for N5 in a section in my copy so I can memorize them in my free time, a section for every lesson grammar, and a section for vocabulary with answering book questions.\nI have chosen to study for 4 hours but to behonest life won\u0026rsquo;t relieve you for it grap so when I could not I had to make up time to waste hours. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish the whole book before the exam, I have just finished 5 first lessons.\nI did not focus on writing much and speaking since these skills are not tested in the exam, it\u0026rsquo;s a Muiltbull choice question, for Reading, Grammar, vocabulary, and lastly Listening.\nNote You can enhance your skills of speaking and writing if you wish when preparing for the exam but you need to put extra time and effort. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t because my life experience is different from you all, and I respect it.\nPlease find the Links to resources in the Links Section I used to help me study the language on my own.\nConclusion Now, after I have given you some brief about my studying plan I still choose learning by myself for my N3 JLPT. My reason for studying Japanese it may sound silly but I want to watch anime without subtitles and as I am trying to find an opportunity to complete my higher studies in Japan, I want to be comfortable with the language.\nMy result of the 1st Des 2024 Exam as shown, it shows that I did not pass! But considering everything I have mentioned above, I see an achievement and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to bring the maximum score I want the passing which is 80. Yet, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have them this time. Finally, My plan now is to prepare for N3 as I have a whole year to prepare for the exam. And if I did not pass that one I\u0026rsquo;ll repeat it till I get the passing score.\nJust take it easy.\nLinks üì¨ Email Me ‚òï Coffee Me üåê List for N5 Kanji ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Mina no Nihon GO Book ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Memorise Kanji üåê Japanese Short Stories Free ","date":"2025-01-31T18:42:53+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0005.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-fifth-post/","title":"How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language | Part 2"},{"content":"Intro From the topic, today\u0026rsquo;s blog is about Using entertainment for language skills\nAs I remember!üòá After high school I was easily taking my life, cause all I knew back then was that my life hit a dead wall for some reason I will keep off this time, to focus on today\u0026rsquo;s topic.\nIt was around 2011 and 2012 or maybe 2013, when I had one main idea in my mind which was how I can develop my language skills. My main focus was the English Language because my mother tongue wasn\u0026rsquo;t English.üòè\nTo find the resources to help myself find new vocals; there were English songs and TV series! But what was on TV I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it!ü•∏ Because the Internet had amazing options like a series called Supernatural, Sam was my favorite! I saw the first of two seasons on TV and when I checked the Internet they were during the 3rd or 4th season, I needed to catch on\u0026hellip;üòé\nYet, back then I didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about torrents!üòÅ The websites I had were paid to watch not free \u0026ldquo;I know nothing is supposed to be free for copywrites\u0026rdquo;. But It\u0026rsquo;s not me it was away at that time and it was normal at the time. Also, there were some illegal websites for a person like me who could not pay to watch for free\u0026hellip;.!üòÆ‚Äçüí®\nThe bummer was they did not have American series they had Korean drama, Japanese drama, and Anime!!!!!\nHere Is How Everything Started!üò≥ I began watching first with Korean Drama; Coffee Prince my all-time favorite. Then Boys Before Flowers\u0026hellip; and some that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember now. It helped me gain new words every day cause Korean I wasn\u0026rsquo;t understand so, I checked the subtitles to know what happening.\nThis really helped me be good at Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening;\nReading: I had to read the subtitles to understand what was happening. Any word I did not know I used to ask my cousin and the early Google translator which use to suck. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember using a dictionary\u0026hellip; hmmm I don\u0026rsquo;t remember.\nWriting: taking up words and writing them on my notes was that was all. And I used to use them in writing on my FB Page, massaging my friends \u0026hellip; that was it.\nSpeaking: I begin using them with my own language! This helped me know how to pronounce it correctly. It got me some laughs on but no worries.\nListening: this was tricky since by listening to Korean a lot I really became familiar with it.\nA Brilliant Idea Come-up\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t I start also learning Korean! I\u0026rsquo;ll hit two birds with one stone since learning languages has become my goal. And I did it and started learning the alphabet and watching. I kept doing this for a while.\nThen my friend N \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;her name starts with N\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;, to avoid any confusion. She told me to watch an anime with her and I did not resist yet, I welcomed the idea. Gosick was the one I began with my friend watching the anime. After that, I am still watching anime. I started loving Japan, Japanese culture, and language.\nI Think Ending This Blog Here, Is A Good Idea! This fancy kind of story is here.ü§≠ I can proudly say that I have passed my IELTS exam with a very pleasant mark and I did my N5 first JLPT exam on Dec 2024; still waiting for the results.\nI can have another special blog on My favorite anime, How I prepare for the N5 JLPT exam, and maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll share my IELTS success story! I may share my own tips for learning languages as self-study.And the best resources that I used from ppl I saw as experts in it.\nSo, till next Friday, take it easy.\nLinks üì¨ Email Me ‚òï Coffee Me ","date":"2025-01-23T16:52:13+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0004.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-forth-post/","title":"How Anime Inspired My Passion for the Japanese Language"},{"content":"Who! After 13 years of working a job, freelance, then changing locations another corporate job, getting fired for the first time, and a new job, another new job. And I quit. My mindset become clear to start building a personal brand for myself.\nAway for my personal growth journey, I am Maha, 32 years old. Living on earth in a country name Pakistan.\nWhy! As I mentioned above what I think good experience from my working life. I have decided to do what I used to do to grow other people\u0026rsquo;s brands, clients, and companies. I want to use my talents and skills for myself.\nWhy!\nFirst I want to create a showcase from myself to everyone else who is hesitating. If it git to bad idea then, it‚Äôs proof to myself that I Fucked up. It‚Äôs Now or Later Not now or never. But I decided for now to do IT. What I want To do! I said it earlier in my first post, but here I want to specify it.\nMy Plan:\nCreate a webpage with Hugo themes and Github. Checked it ^ this was like going through hell, gladly I did it.\nI want to start Digital drawing and manga creation. Post about my leveling up here too, or maybe open a Youtube channel!! I still don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nI have two freelance brands one is in Photography and the other is making candles. In photography, I have a ground to stand on but candles going to be new. So I need to build it correctly.\nBefore the last, I like learning new cultures and languages so I am doing Japanese now.\nLastly, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll have as an interest in the future.\nConclusion I know having multitasking with multiple interests is not a good idea! Yet, being inspiraed by Elon Musk, as he go\u0026rsquo;s through different companies in one day, motivated me. So, I‚Äôm not him I can not do all in one day, instead, I‚Äôll do is to give all the needed time for one thing in time.\nMy Priorities are, Learning Japanese for JLPT/N3 before upcoming July 2025 for like 1-2 hours a day. I can also have another thing like drawing since my first drawing table will arrive today Saturday 18, 2025, to give 2-3 hours is doable too.\nFinally, I make sure to have a separate blog post for each thing I mentioned above, to give a background and share the present and future perspectives.\nLink ‚òï Coffee Me ","date":"2025-01-17T17:50:59+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0003.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-third-post/","title":"Who am I?

To be honest, I am no developer or programmer, but I really wanted to create a website with the most easy way with an #OpenSourceTools. Plus, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to use drag and drop websites cause I want to gain a bit knowledge how websites work. I have been struggling over the past year to create my website with #HugoStack; time was not on my side becasue of work and studies. I needed to be focused and free which is exactly what I have now.\nAnd for my awesome luck, I have a brother who knows things about creating website and coding, he was the one who told me about github and hugo. \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t say much, but he takes a bit of credit for helping me with this :P\u0026rdquo;.\nThe issue was that I needed to covert YAML to TOML, and guess what happens when this saying describes you correctly. \u0026ldquo;You Know Nothing John Snow\u0026rdquo;. Yet, when I was trying I used the same solution my bro did, but it did not work with me as always he has the magical touch :/ of coding.\nAlso, from him I\u0026rsquo;ve heard! That YAML and TOML are everyone\u0026rsquo;s headache; I am not the only one. But me happily and with my bro aid, my website is ready and good to go.\nThe Problem: (about, archive, and coffee me page) in the main sidebar was not apperaring on my localhost.\nSidebar pic was not apperaring also!\nThe Solution: [menu]\n[[menu.social]] identifier= 'youtube' name= 'YouTube' weight= 1 url= '' [menu.social.params] icon= 'youtube' [[menu.main]] identifier= \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; name= \u0026quot;Home\u0026quot; url= \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; weight= -3 pre= \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; [menu.main.params] ### For demonstration purpose, the home link will be open in a new tab newTab= false For sidebar pic to show up use this path and save the pic in this dirctory.\n[ /home/user/Desktop/blog/yoursitename/themes/hugo-theme-stack/assets/img ]\nThis is an example to anyone who is suffering like me.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all, have fun.\nUseful-Links ‚òï Coffee Me üìΩ Creating a Blog with Hugo and Github in 10 minutes\n","date":"2025-01-10T18:03:11+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0002.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-second-post/","title":"Hugo Theme Stack Is Getting Me Fusturated!!!!"},{"content":"Since covid..

For a fact I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do, since ‚ÄúBurnout is real‚Äù.\nBecause there are other personal responsibilities, personal care, and friends time weekly.\nSo, on Nov-2024 I quit the job and I am thinking of doing the things that were hunting my mind when I was working.
