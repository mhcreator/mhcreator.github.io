[{"content":"Since covid.. I have been thinking about quitting my job!!\nBut these moments when it hits you feel like you are a dreamer or a fairy tail (you wonder why this idea is happening in your mind? Why do you even feel this way?) and fear comes to take the courage aways. So I convinced myself that I can do it, while working and studying. For a fact I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do, since “Burnout is real”.\nBecause there are other personal responsibilities, personal care, and friends time weekly.\nSo, on Nov-2024 I quit the job and I am thinking of doing the things that were hunting my mind when I was working. Like blogging, creating a brand, and digital drawing. To be honest fear is eating my head about not achieving the goal or it might be a studpied idea… but the relief I’m feeling makes me like the idea of keeping it up.\nTherefore, Let me see what I can do till 2025 finishes.\nLinks 🐦 My Twitter Profile ","date":"2025-01-08T14:18:06+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/slug/","title":"My First Post"}]
