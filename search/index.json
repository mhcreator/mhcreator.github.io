[{"content":"Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s get into it..\nI had my time trying to find what is the issue!! (like around 3 days).\nBut nothing happen as I wanted! To be honest, I am no developer or programmer, but I really wanted to create a website with the most easy way with an #OpenSourceTools. Plus, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to use drag and drop websites cause I want to gain a bit knowledge how websites work. I have been struggling over the past year to create my website with #HugoStack; time was not on my side becasue of work and studies. I needed to be focused and free which is exactly what I have now.\nAnd for my awesome luck, I have a brother who knows things about creating website and coding, he was the one who told me about github and hugo. \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t say much, but he takes a bit of credit for helping me with this :P\u0026rdquo;.\nThe issue was that I needed to covert YAML to TOML, and guess what happens when this saying describes you correctly. \u0026ldquo;You Know Nothing John Snow\u0026rdquo;. Yet, when I was trying I used the same solution my bro did, but it did not work with me as always he has the magical touch :/ of coding.\nAlso, from him I\u0026rsquo;ve heard! That YAML and TOML are everyone\u0026rsquo;s headache; I am not the only one. But me happily and with my bro aid, my website is ready and good to go.\nThe Problem: (about, archive, and coffee me page) in the main sidebar was not apperaring on my localhost.\nSidebar pic was not apperaring also!\nThe Solution: [menu]\n[[menu.social]] identifier= 'youtube' name= 'YouTube' weight= 1 url= '' [menu.social.params] icon= 'youtube' [[menu.main]] identifier= \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; name= \u0026quot;Home\u0026quot; url= \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; weight= -3 pre= \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; [menu.main.params] ### For demonstration purpose, the home link will be open in a new tab newTab= false For sidebar pic to show up use this path and save the pic in this dirctory.\n[ /home/user/Desktop/blog/yoursitename/themes/hugo-theme-stack/assets/img ]\nThis is an example to anyone who is suffering like me.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all, have fun.\nUseful-Links üìΩ Creating a Blog with Hugo and Github in 10 minutes ","date":"2025-01-10T18:03:11+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0002.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/my-second-post/","title":"Hugo Theme Stack Is Getting Me Fusturated!!!!"},{"content":"Since covid.. I have been thinking about quitting my job!!\nBut these moments when it hits you feel like you are a dreamer or a fairy tail (you wonder why this idea is happening in your mind? Why do you even feel this way?) and fear comes to take the courage aways. So I convinced myself that I can do it, while working and studying. For a fact I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do, since ‚ÄúBurnout is real‚Äù.\nBecause there are other personal responsibilities, personal care, and friends time weekly.\nSo, on Nov-2024 I quit the job and I am thinking of doing the things that were hunting my mind when I was working. Like blogging, creating a brand, and digital drawing. To be honest fear is eating my head about not achieving the goal or it might be a studpied idea‚Ä¶ but the relief I‚Äôm feeling makes me like the idea of keeping it up.\nTherefore, Let me see what I can do till 2025 finishes.\nLinks üê¶ My Twitter Profile ","date":"2025-01-08T14:18:06+05:00","image":"http://localhost:1313/0001.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/slug/","title":"My First Post"}]
